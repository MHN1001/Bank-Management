# Bank Management Project

## Overview
The **Bank Management Project** is a C++ console application designed to simulate basic banking operations. It uses **file-based storage** to manage data for users, clients, and transactions, providing a simple yet effective way to learn object-oriented programming, file handling, and project structuring in C++.  

The project features a **modular architecture**, separating concerns into folders like `Core`, `Screens`, and `DataBase(Files)` for easy maintenance and scalability.
